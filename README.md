Hello World 👋🏼  

I began my coding journey in my 30s,    
and I’m someone who focuses on personal growth by comparing myself to who I was yesterday, rather than to others.   
While coding is my profession, I am also interested in health, the environment, and history.       
Currently, I work as a web developer in Ulsan, South Korea.
